# Node.js API with MongoDB

This is a sample Node.js API project that uses MongoDB for data storage and implements basic security measures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

 
   git clone https://github.com/itsivali/node-api-mongodb.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   cd node-api-mongodb

3. Install dependencies:
   npm install


4. Start the server:
   npm start


The server will be running at http://localhost:3000.

## Features

    User registration: Register a new user with a unique username and a password.
    User login: Authenticate users with their username and password using bcrypt for password hashing.
    Protected routes: Access protected routes by providing a JWT token obtained upon successful login.

## API Endpoints

    POST /register: Register a new user. Requires a JSON body with a username and password field.
    POST /login: Log in a user. Requires a JSON body with a username and password field. Returns a JWT token upon successful login.
    GET /protected: Access a protected endpoint. Requires an Authorization header with a valid JWT token.

## Security Measures

    Password hashing: User passwords are securely hashed using bcrypt before being stored in the database.
    JWT authentication: User authentication is implemented using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for stateless and secure authentication.
    Rate limiting: API endpoints are protected by rate limiting to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks.
    Input validation: User input is validated and sanitized using the express-validator library to prevent common security vulnerabilities.

## Technologies Used

    Node.js
    Express.js
    MongoDB
    Mongoose
    bcrypt
    JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
